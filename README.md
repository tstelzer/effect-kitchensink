# @tstelzer/effect-kitchensink

My personal collection of utilities for the effect ecosystem.

## You should probably not use this.

1. Even though I technically use semver for versioning, and the library is past
   v1, the API is highly volatile. I'll likely, freely, remove functionality as
   I discover alternatives.
2. Most of the functionality is likely going to be replaced by other effect
   ecosystem libraries (node, http, etc).

Feel free to reach out on the [discord effect server](https://discord.gg/8nzxdVB2zG), or by creating an issue.

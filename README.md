# @tstelzer/effect-kitchensink

My personal collection of utilities for the effect ecosystem (`@effect/io`,
`@fp-ts/core`, etc).

## Beware

1. Even though I technically use semver for versioning, and the library is past
   v1, the interface is still highly volatile.
2. Most of the functionality is likely going to be replaced by other effect
   ecosystem libraries (node, http, etc).
3. Currently untested.
